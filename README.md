# Teleplan Web Service Examples

These html pages demonstrate the functions of the Teleplan Web Services.  They are provided to 3rd party developers to assist in calling the Web Services.   These are for development and demonstration purposes only, not to be incorporated into any software.

These are "live" files.   The `index.html` file can be opened in any browser by just double clicking on it.  Links to the other files are inside.   All the forms, such as login, logout, etc work. You just need to press the "back" key on the browser to return to the page after getting a response.
